It would seem that most people start with an *"about me"* page so why should this be any different. I am Graham Arden and I live in North Wales with Melissa. We
have three children: [Tom] (http://xkcd.com/1198/ "Geologist") who is currently working in Australia, Caitlin who is studying in [Bristol] (http://www.uwe.ac.uk) and our youngest Ffion
who is studying at [Llysfasi College](http://www.cambria.ac.uk/), near Ruthin.

I have worked in the [NHS] (http://www.keepournhspublic.com/index.php "Save the NHS") for the last 28 years and am currently gainfully employed as a Radiotherapy Physicist at the North Wales Cancer Treatment Centre.

I know some [Python] (http://www.python.org), For interactive data processing and visualisation I use [iPython](http://ipython.org).  Some of my hacked together nonsense is available via my [Github](https://github.com/trigfa) pages 
although little of it is likely to prove useful to anyone else.

My other intersets include music, comedy, [running](http://www.abergeleharriers.co.uk/ASH.htm "..although my running could be described as comedy") and hill walking

All posts are made in a purely personal capacity, are strictly my own opinion and none of my employers business. 

No pop, no style, strictly roots...
