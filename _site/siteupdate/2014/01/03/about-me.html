<p class="meta">03 Jan 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>It would seem that most people start with an <em>&quot;about me&quot;</em> page so why should this be any different. I am Graham Arden and I live in North Wales with Melissa. We
have three children: <a href="http://xkcd.com/1198/" title="Geologist">Tom</a> who is currently working in Australia, Caitlin who is studying in <a href="http://www.uwe.ac.uk">Bristol</a> and our youngest Ffion
who is studying at <a href="http://www.cambria.ac.uk/">Llysfasi College</a>, near Ruthin.</p>

<p>I have worked in the <a href="http://www.keepournhspublic.com/index.php" title="Save the NHS">NHS</a> for the last 28 years and am currently gainfully employed as a Radiotherapy Physicist at the North Wales Cancer Treatment Centre.</p>

<p>I know some <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, For interactive data processing and visualisation I use <a href="http://ipython.org">iPython</a>.  Some of my hacked together nonsense is available via my <a href="https://github.com/trigfa">Github</a> pages 
although little of it is likely to prove useful to anyone else.</p>

<p>My other intersets include music, comedy, <a href="http://www.abergeleharriers.co.uk/ASH.htm" title="..although my running could be describes as comedy">running</a> and hill walking</p>

<p>All posts are made in a purely personal capacity, are strictly my own opinion and none of my employers business. No pop, no style, strictly roots...</p>
